Utilities/tests/manual/contools/callf:

  * Fix the case where the
    `callf /tee-stdin 0.log /pipe-stdin-to-child-stdin "" "cmd.exe /k"`
    expression has broken/altered autocompletion feature in the `cmd.exe` process
    and the `cmd.exe` treats all the tab characters as is.

    The issue is attached to the stdin handle type inside the `cmd.exe` process.
    If the stdin handle has not a character device type
    (GetFileType(GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE)) != FILE_TYPE_CHAR), then the
    autocompletion feature is turned off and all characters including a tab
    character processes as is. Otherwise the tab button press triggers
    the autocompletion feature.

    The stdin handle changes its type from the `FILE_TYPE_CHAR`, for example, if
    the process input is redirected.

    The fix can be made portably between different Windows versions, for example,
    through the code injection into a child process and interception of the
    `ReadConsole`/`WriteConsole` calls.

  * Fix `start "" /WAIT callfg.exe /attach-parent-console "" "unexisted.exe"`
    invalid print in non 65001 code page.

  * Fix `callf.exe /detach-console "" "unexisted.exe"` crash.

  * Fix `callf.exe` long paths open.

  * Fix `callf.exe /shell-exec-unelevate-from-explorer /D . "callf.exe" "/shell-exec runas \"${COMSPEC}\" \"/k\""`
    current directory propagation.

  * fix slow print:
