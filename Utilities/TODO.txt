* Fix the case where the `callf.exe "" "cmd.exe /k"` expression has broken
  autocompletion feature in the `cmd.exe` process and the `cmd.exe` treats all
  the tab characters as is.
  The bug is attached to the `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` flag is used from the
  `CreateProcess` function.
  If the flag is not set, then the autocompletion feature works, but the
  standard output can not be redirected and intercepted.
