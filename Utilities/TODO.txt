* Add to callf flags:
  ** `/ret-create-proc`             - return CreateProcess return value
  ** `/ret-win-error`               - return Win32 error code
  ** `/ret-child-exit`              - return child process exit code (if has no `/no-wait` flag)
  ** `/print-win-error-string`      - print Win32 error string (even if `/ret-win-error` is not set)
  ** `/no-wait`                     - don't wait a child process exit
  ** `/no-window`                   - don't show a child process console window
  ** `/no-expand-env`               - don't expand `${...}` environment variables
  ** `/no-subst-vars`               - don't substitute `{...}` variables
  ** `/tee-std[in|out|err] <file>`  - duplicate stream to <file>
    If more than one `/tee` flag with the same file is present, then handles process order based on `/tee-*` flags order.
  ** `/tee-std[in|out|err]-append   - append instead of rewrite for the previously declared `<file>`
  ** `/tee-std[in|out|err]-flush`   - flush after each write to the previously declared `<file>`
