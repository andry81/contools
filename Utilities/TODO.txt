* Fix the case where the `callf.exe "" "cmd.exe /k"` expression has broken
  autocompletion feature in the `cmd.exe` process and the `cmd.exe` treats all
  the tab characters as is.
  The bug is attached to the `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` flag and if related
  standard handles is used from the `CreateProcess` function.
  If the flag is not set or all 3 stdandard handles are character (console)
  handles (not disk or pipe handles), then the autocompletion feature works,
  but the standard output can not be redirected and intercepted.
  If the flag is set and one of 3 handles is not character (console) handle,
  then the autocompletion feature is broken, but the standard output can be
  redirected and intercepted.

* Hookup WriteFile on the stdout/stderr in a child process to force file buffer
  flush on each write. Can fix a progress stall based on stdout/stderr
  buffering.

* Support console clear by the `cls` command from the `callf "" "cmd.exe /k"`
  process console input.
