* Fix the case where the
  `callf /tee-stdin 0.log /pipe-stdin-to-child-stdin "" "cmd.exe /k"`
  expression has broken/altered autocompletion feature in the `cmd.exe` process
  and the `cmd.exe` treats all the tab characters as is.

  The issue is attached to the stdin handle type inside the `cmd.exe` process.
  If the stdin handle has not a character device type
  (GetFileType(GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE)) != FILE_TYPE_CHAR), then the
  autocompletion feature is turned off and all characters including a tab
  character processes as is. Otherwise the tab button press triggers
  the autocompletionn feature.

  The stdin handle changes its type from the `FILE_TYPE_CHAR`, for example, if
  the process input is redirected.

  The fix can be made portably between different Windows versions, for example,
  through the code injection into a child process and interception of the
  `ReadConsole`/`WriteConsole` calls.

* Hookup WriteFile on the stdout/stderr in a child process to force file buffer
  flush on each write. Can fix a progress stall based on stdout/stderr
  buffering.

* Hookup SEH exception filter in a child process to intercept SEH exception
  being throwed out of a child process to be able to pause-on-error in the
  parent `callf.exe` process even if a child process didn't return non zero
  return code.

* Get injected into parent process being used for console window attachment and
  directly call `GetStdHandle` functions to read standard handle addresses
  layout to update the standard handles (call `StdStdHandle`) in the process,
  where console is attached.

* In `callfg` by default create/attach the console on demand if not yet
  attached or created, for example, in case of print into console because of an
  error. Add a flag to suppress such behaviour.
  In `callf` by default show if hidden or create if detached/not attached the
  console on demand the same way as for the `callfg`.

* Fix `callfg.exe /attach-parent-console "" "unexisted.exe"` invalid print and
  return code in non 65001 code page.

* Fix `callfg.exe /attach-parent-console "" "unexisted.exe"` crash in 65001
  code page.

* Implement `/disable-parent-ctrl-signals` and `/disable-parent-ctrl-c-signal`
  through a parent process injection to avoid a parent process to close when it
  can not avoid it by itself.
  For example `mintty` process in Windows does close itself on ctrl-c press and
  terminates the child process too when the child process can run in
  interactive mode and should not close upon the ctrl-c press:
  `mintty.exe -e cmd.exe /k`
