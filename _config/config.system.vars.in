#%% version: 1

# CAUTION:
#  This configuration file is designed to be portable between 2 interpreters: unix shell scripts, windows (cmd.exe) batch scripts,
#  so it is made up to be simple as possible but not simplier as to support a single value or a values list
#  together with an escape sequence, where the character `\` is not an escape sequence character.
#  Use `$/<char>` to escape a `<char>` character which is a part of a configuration file format:
#  `"` -> `$/"` or `$/` -> `$/$/`
#  Use `$/{` as a start sequence for a variable's value substitution: `$/{<variable>}`, where `<variable>`
#  is already parsed variable from configuration file WITHOUT condition(s) or `:` characters. Otherwise a not yet parsed variable or
#  invalid one will be replaced by the `*:$/{<variable>}` sequence to fail the most usage cases in a file path,
#  where `*:` - is not valid character sequence in a windows path (`:` character additionally can block a relative path *after* the variable)
#  and `/` is a character to block a file or directory creation with such a name on a Linux system (but not a block for `mkdir -p`!).
#  In all other cases the `$/` sequence prints as is in all contexts: in a unix shell script and in a windows batch script.

# FORMAT:
#   [<attributes>] <variable>[:[<class_name>]]=<value>
#
# <attributes>:           Variable space separated attributes: once | export | upath
# <variable>:             Variable name corresponding to the regex: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*
# <class_name>:           class variant name: OSWIN | OSUNIX | BAT | SH
#   OSWIN:                Apply on Windows system including cygwin/mingw/msys subsystems.
#   OSUNIX:               Apply on Unix/Linux systems excluding cygwin/mingw/msys subsystems.
#   BAT:                  Apply on Windows system when this file has loaded from the Windows batch script loader.
#   SH:                   Apply on any system when this file has loaded from the Bash shell script loader.
#
# <value>:                Value with escaping and substitution support: `$/<escape_char>`, `$/{<variable>}`.
#                         Can start by the `"` quote character, but two quotes does remove only when exist on both ends of a value.
