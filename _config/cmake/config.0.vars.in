#%% version: 1

# CAUTION:
#  This configuration file is designed to be portable between 3 interpreters: cmake, unix shell scripts, windows (cmd.exe) batch scripts,
#  so it is made up to be simple as possible but not simpler as to support a single value or a values list
#  together with an escape sequence, where the character `\` is not an escape sequence character.
#  Use `$/<char>` to escape a `<char>` character which is a part of a configuration file format:
#  `"` -> `$/"` or `(` -> `$/(` or `$/` -> `$/$/`
#  Use `$/{` as a start sequence for a variable's value substitution: `$/{<variable>}`, where `<variable>`
#  is already parsed variable from configuration file WITHOUT condition(s) or `:` characters. Otherwise a not yet parsed variable or
#  invalid one will be replaced by the `*:$/{<variable>}` sequence to fail the most usage cases in a file path,
#  where `*:` - is not valid character sequence in a windows path (`:` character additionally can block a relative path *after* the variable)
#  and `/` is a character to block a file or directory creation with such a name on a Linux system (but not a block for `mkdir -p`!).
#  In all other cases the `$/` sequence prints as is in all contexts: in a cmake script, in a unix shell script and in a
#  windows batch script.

# CAUTION:
#  DO NOT USE `@` character pairs unescaped as a plain value as long as it is used as a placeholder in a replacement of `@<variable>@` sequence,
#  where the `<variable>` is a cmake variable. For that case do replace all `@` characters by this escape sequence: `$/@`.
#  It will avoid the substitution in case of an accidental match.

# NOTE:
#  In a unix shell script a variable name with `:` character is not permitted, so variables with not allowed characters
#  won't be visible in a windows batch script too.
