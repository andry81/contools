- Add scripts (`svn_save_props_by_list`/`svn_save_props_by_nested_wc`) to
  save `svn:*` properties for selected files and directories to
  `<selected_dir>/.<svn_prop_name>` for a selected directory, to
  `<selected_dir>/.svnprops/<file_ext_name>/<svn_prop_name>.txt` for a file
  in a selected directory and to
  `<selected_file_dir>/.svnprops/<file_ext_name>/<svn_prop_name>.txt` for a
  selected file.
  If related files representing being saved properties has already existed
  before and there is changes with existing properties content, then a
  property must be saved into a temporary file and the file comparison window
  must be opened to merge the changes from the temporary file with the being
  saved file. After merge into temporary files those of them which has been
  changed must be writen back into the properties, otherwise left the
  properties unchanged.

- Add scripts (`svn_load_props_by_list`/`svn_load_props_by_nested_wc`) to
  load `svn:*` properties for selected files and directories from
  `<selected_dir>/.<svn_prop_name>` for a selected directory, from
  `<selected_dir>/.svnprops/<file_ext_name>/<svn_prop_name>.txt` for a file
  in a selected directory and from
  `<selected_file_dir>/.svnprops/<file_ext_name>/<svn_prop_name>.txt` for a
  selected file.
  If related files representing being loaded properties has already existed
  before and there is changes with existing properties content, then a
  property must be saved into a temporary file and the file comparison window
  must be opened to merge the changes from the temporary file with the being
  loaded file. After the merge into all temporary files must be writen back
  into the properties if they are changed, otherwise leave the properties not
  changed. After merge into temporary files those of them which has been
  changed must be writen back into the properties, otherwise left the
  properties unchanged.

- Add scripts (`svn_sync_props_by_list`/`svn_sync_props_by_nested_wc`) to
  save/load `svn:*` properties for selected files and directories to/from
  `<selected_dir>/.<svn_prop_name>` for a selected directory, to/from
  `<selected_dir>/.svnprops/<file_ext_name>/<svn_prop_name>.txt` for a file
  in a selected directory and to/from
  `<selected_file_dir>/.svnprops/<file_ext_name>/<svn_prop_name>.txt`
  for a selected file.
  If related files representing being saved/loaded properties has already
  existed before and there is changes with existing properties content, then
  a property must be saved into a temporary file and the file comparison
  window must be opened to merge the changes from the temporary file with the
  being saved/loaded file. After merge into temporary files those of them
  which has been changed must be writen back into the properties, otherwise
  left the properties unchanged.

Note:
  A merge into being saved/loaded property files and into temporary files
  must be handled by an external comparison/merging utility. To do it a
  temporary directory with property files must be constructed for both
  sides of a comparison/merge.

- Add scripts (`svn_edit_props_by_list`/`svn_edit_props_by_nested_wc`) to
  edit `svn:*` properties for selected files and directories.
  To do so save `svn:*` properties for selected files and directories to
  `<temp_dir>/<path_index>_<path_dir_name>/.<svn_prop_name>` for a selected
  directory, to
  `<temp_dir>/<path_index>_<path_dir_name>/<file_name>/.<svn_prop_name>` for a
  file in a selected directory and to
  `<temp_dir>/<path_index>_<path_file_name>/.<svn_prop_name>` for a selected
  file, where:
    <temp_dir> - generated temporary directory.
    <path_index> - index associated with a selection path.
    <path_dir_name> - a directory name in selection directory path.
    <path_file_name> - a file name in selection file path.
    <file_name> - name of a file in a selection directory path.
  Scripts would open a Notepad to edit all related property files together or
  one by one.
