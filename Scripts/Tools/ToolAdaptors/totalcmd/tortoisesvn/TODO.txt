TortoiseProcByNestedWC script:
  - /command:commit may show changes in the same window for the same remote directory:
      WCDIR1/parent_path/ext1
      WCDIR2/parent_path/ext1
    , where ext1 points to the same remote directory.
    Add a flag to split (or do not split) such directories into different lists and does show them in separate windows to sequence collided commits.
