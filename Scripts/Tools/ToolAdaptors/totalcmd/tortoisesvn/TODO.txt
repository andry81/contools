TortoiseProcByNestedWC script:
  - /command:repostatus (/command:commit) shows duplicated changes if pathfile list has parent paths and paths with externals to the same repository from parent path:
      repo1/parent_path
      repo1/parent_path/ext1
    but, in this case this is correct duplication:
      repo1/parent_path
      repo2/parent_path/ext1
  - /command:commit may show changes in the same window for the same remote directory:
      WCDIR1/parent_path/ext1
      WCDIR2/parent_path/ext1
    , where ext1 points to the same remote directory.
    Add a flag to split (or do not split) such directories into different lists and does show them in separate windows to sequence collided commits.
