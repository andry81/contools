TortoiseProcByNestedWC script:
  - /command:repostatus shows duplicated changes if pathfile list has parent paths and paths with externals to the same repository from parent path:
      repo1/parent_path
      repo1/parent_path/ext1
    but, in this case this is correct duplication:
      repo1/parent_path
      repo2/parent_path/ext1
  - /command:commit may show windows with no active versioned changes but with disabled changes which are changes for different repositories.
