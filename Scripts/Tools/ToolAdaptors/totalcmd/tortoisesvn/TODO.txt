TortoiseProcByNestedWC script:
  - /command:commit may show changes in the same window for the same remote directory:
      WCDIR1/parent_path/ext1
      WCDIR2/parent_path/ext1
    , where ext1 points to the same remote directory.
    Add a flag to split (or do not split) such directories into different lists and does show them in separate windows to sequence collided commits.
  - Not versioned directories does filter out, for example, in all-in-one mode or in /command:repostatus command which leads to miss records with nested status.
    User may forget to add such directories to the version control, so even the /commad:commit should show these records to warning a user about unversioned records before the commit.
