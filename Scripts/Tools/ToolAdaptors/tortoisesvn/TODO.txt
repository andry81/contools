TortoiseProc script:
  - call by list, collect all parent directories where exists a child directory ".svn\" and create path list file in format of UCS2 w/o BOM.
  - /command:repostatus /pathfile:"<pathfile>" /deletepathfile
  - /command:commit /pathfile:"<pathfile>" /deletepathfile
  - workaround repostatus not showing nested WC if they referenced in nested directories (can be workarounded through the entire directory tree replication by the "mklink /D" command)
