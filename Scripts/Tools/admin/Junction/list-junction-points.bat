rem CAUTION:
rem   1. If a variable is empty, then it would not be expanded in the `cmd.exe`
rem      command line or in the inner expression of the
rem      `for /F "usebackq ..." %%i in (`<inner-expression>`) do ...`
rem      statement.
rem   2. The `cmd.exe` command line or the inner expression of the
rem      `for /F "usebackq ..." %%i in (`<inner-expression>`) do ...`
rem      statement does expand twice.
rem
rem   We must expand the command line into a variable to avoid these above.
