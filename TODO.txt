* Rewrite to assign a short path version only after compare of the path before
  assignment with the path after assignment. If both paths are not case
  insensitively equal, then only after do request the short version path from
  the path before assignment.

  Currently, the path after assignment checks on existence and if does not
  exist, then the short path version is requested. This would not work if the
  path after assignment is truncated or corrupted to a path that accidentally
  exist.
