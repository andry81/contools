* Tools/ToolAdaptors/vbs/update_shortcut_props_from_dir.bat:

  Recover broken directory shortcuts which were file shortcuts using
  `Description` key, because it used by the system to save a shortcut file path
  before auto convertion into a directory shortcut.

  Add flag `-allow-recover-file-shortcuts` to detect and recover that case.

  If a file path does not exist, then ignore recovery if path rename is not
  requested.

  Apply path rename to a path from the Description key and if exist continue
  recover.
