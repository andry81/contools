   of print it in case of including via "source" command to reduce quantity of
   console shell-process instantiation duaring scripts execution.

   endlocal command with option to do not drop required set of variables.

 - Added cat2.sh script.
 - Added dos2unix.bat and unix2dos.bat scripts.
 - Made direct usage of TOOLS_PATH variable in scripts instead of adding it to
   the PATH variable. Now you always should define TOOLS_PATH variable before

   will define it as a path to the directory where the script is.
